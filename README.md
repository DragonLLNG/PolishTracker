# PolishTracker
Capstone project for 4155
This project intends to help the users to store their nails products that they have used or want to try and share them with their friends. With regular camera everyone can save their pictures and create an album but with Polish Tracker users will be able to add their note to the picture and update the collection whenever they want. The app is different than other nail polishes tracker apps by allowing the user to add friends and share their polish with them.
